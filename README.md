# Kmeans_Clustering
**Implemented in Python.**

K-means Clustering Algorithm is a centroid-based technique which partitions a given unlabelled dataset into k clusters, creating high intra-class similarity and low inter-class similarity. Each cluster is represented by its center (i.e, centroid) which corresponds to the mean of points assigned to the cluster.

***There are 3 main steps involved:***
1. Initialize centroids;
2. Assign points to centroid; 
3. Update centroid location to cluster mean.
